> An AI-powered sexual education content generator built for awareness, accuracy, and accessibility.



## 📘 Overview

AI-based system designed to generate **accurate, age-appropriate, and context-aware educational responses** to questions related to **sexual health and education**.  

The project uses **transformer-based language models** (such as GPT or T5 architectures) combined with **prompt-engineering techniques** and **ethical content filtering** to ensure safe, factual, and inclusive information delivery.

The system is structured within a Jupyter Notebook (`sexed_ans(3).ipynb`) for research, experimentation, and demonstration of **responsible text generation** in sensitive educational domains.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🧬 **Generate** sexual education responses that are informative, respectful, and unbiased.  
- 🔍 **Ensure safety and ethical compliance** using content filtering and controlled generation.  
- 🧩 **Demonstrate fine-tuning** and prompt-based conditioning for specific response control.  
- 🌐 **Promote accessibility** of sex education through AI-driven conversational tools.  

---

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ **Transformer-based text generation**
- 🧠 **Contextual prompt conditioning** for structured outputs  
- 🧹 **Toxicity and bias filtering** using moderation layers  
- 📊 **Data preprocessing and tokenization pipeline**  
- 💬 **Q&A simulation** for real-world usage  
- 🌱 **Customizable notebook** for researchers and educators

| **5. Response Generation** | Generate educational answers using the model          |
| **6. Filtering**           | Apply toxicity, bias, and coherence filters           |
| **7. Evaluation**          | Review generated outputs, analyze model performance   |


##  Ethical Considerations
This project is developed for **educational and research purposes** only.  
It aims to promote **scientifically accurate and socially responsible** sexual education.  

**Key ethical guidelines followed:**
- No explicit or adult content generation.  
- Ensures inclusivity and gender neutrality.  
- Focuses on awareness, safety, and factual correctness.  
- Uses moderation filters to prevent unsafe responses.  

---

##  Future Work
- 🔹 Fine-tune models on curated sex-education datasets.  
- 🔹 Integrate real-time fact-checking API.  
- 🔹 Develop a web-based chatbot interface.  
- 🔹 Add multilingual support for accessibility.
